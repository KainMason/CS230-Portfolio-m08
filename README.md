The SNHU Travel project aims to develop a travel application using the Scrum-Agile methodology. The application includes features like flight search, personalized travel recommendations, and third-party API integration. The project emphasizes iterative development, continuous feedback, and flexibility to adapt to changing requirements.

Interpreting User Needs and Implementing Them into a Program

I interpret user needs by talking to stakeholders, gathering their requirements, and then prioritizing them based on importance and feasibility. Creating user stories helps because it breaks down these needs into clear, actionable tasks that the development team can focus on, ensuring each feature delivers specific value to the user.

Developing Programs with Agile Processes

I approach developing programs by using an incremental and iterative process. Key Agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work include:

    Sprint Planning: To prioritize and plan work for each sprint.
    Daily Stand-Ups: For team alignment and quick issue resolution.
    Sprint Reviews: To gather feedback from stakeholders.
    Sprint Retrospectives: To continuously improve processes.

Being a Good Team Member in Software Development

Being a good team member involves:

    Collaboration: Actively participating and supporting teammates.
    Communication: Maintaining clear and transparent communication.
    Adaptability: Being flexible and responsive to changes.
    Commitment: Demonstrating dedication to meeting deadlines and delivering quality work.
